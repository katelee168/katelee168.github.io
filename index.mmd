<div style="text-align: justify">Hello! 

I'm currently a Research Engineer at Google Brain Research in San Francisco, CA. 

\

I'm broadly interested in building machine learning systems we can trust. This means figuring out when models are untrustworthy, what knobs change their behavior, and developing interactions and visualizations to learn where strengths and weaknesses of models are. 


Previously, I had great fun learning about how real neural networks (brains!) process their surroundings with [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) and [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/) during my undergrad in Operations Research at Princeton.

## Fun!
In my free time, I enjoy making stuff. Sometimes this is [pottery](https://www.instagram.com/paw_projects/), sourdough, or knitting/crocheting. I also enjoy being outdoors, listening to jazz, and dancing. Sometimes all at the same time!

In the more distant past, Iâ€™ve also solved for optimal seating arrangements at Google, and I spotted ships at bay with hyperspectral sensors at the Naval Research Lab in DC.
