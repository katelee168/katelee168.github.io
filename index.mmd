# Katherine Lee
Hello! 
I'm currently a Research Engineer at Google Brain Research in San Francisco, CA. ![alt text](https://github.com/katelee168/me.JPG"Tartine is still my favorite sourdough")




I'm broadly interested in building machine learning systems we can trust. This means figuring out when models are untrustworthy, what knobs change their behavior, and developing interactions and visualizations to learn where strengths and weaknesses of models are.
